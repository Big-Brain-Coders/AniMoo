Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, many people were required to quarantine and social distance, resulting in limited social interaction and a decline in mental health among communities. This has lead to problems such as: <br>
- Worse mental health outcomes
- Increased substance abuse
- Higher tendencies for suicidal thoughts
<br>
College students are also having difficulty socializing through online classes due to the limitations of Zoom and in-person hangouts. 
<br>
Because of this, watching anime, netflix, and movies has become an incredibly common pastime. 

## Description
AniMoo is a social media platform centered around discussing TV Shows and Movies. The title is wordplay on Anime (Japanese animation) and Movies (hence AniMoo).
With AniMoo, users will be able to add friends to see what kind of shows they like to watch, discuss plot twists from the latest episode of the hot new series, and track whoâ€™s the
biggest Netflix addict among the friend group. With this application, we hope to create connections between students that would otherwise be lacking because of online education.
