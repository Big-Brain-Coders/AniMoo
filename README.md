## Description
AniMoo is a social media platform centered around discussing TV Shows and Movies. The title is wordplay on Anime (Japanese animation) and Movies (hence AniMoo).
With AniMoo, users will be able to add friends to see what kind of shows they like to watch, discuss plot twists from the latest episode of the Hot new series, and track whoâ€™s the
biggest Netflix addict among the friend group. With this application, we hope to create connections between students that would otherwise be lacking because of online education. 
We are excited to implement our solution with Meteor and hope to share our product with you all soon
