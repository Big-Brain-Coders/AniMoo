What makes these giants truly terrifying is that their taste for human flesh is not born out of hunger but what appears to be out of pleasure. To ensure their survival, the remnants of humanity began living within defensive barriers, resulting in one hundred years without a single titan encounter. However, that fragile calm is soon shattered when a colossal titan manages to breach the supposedly impregnable outer wall, reigniting the fight for survival against the man-eating abominations.\r\n\r\nAfter witnessing a horrific personal loss at the hands of the invading creatures, Eren Yeager dedicates his life to their eradication by enlisting into the Survey Corps, an elite military unit that combats the merciless humanoids outside the protection of the walls. Based on Hajime Isayama's award-winning manga, Shingeki no Kyojin follows Eren, along with his adopted sister Mikasa Ackerman and his childhood friend Armin Arlert, as they join the brutal war against the titans and race to discover a way of defeating them before the last walls are breached.\r\n\r\n[]", "type": "TV", "airing_start": "2013-04-06T16:58:00+00:00", "episodes": 25, "members": 3104669, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "Mystery", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/7/Mystery"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 38, "type": "anime", "name": "Military", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/38/Military"}, {"mal_id": 31, "type": "anime", "name": "Super Power", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/31/Super_Power"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "source": "Manga", "producers": [{"mal_id": 858, "type": "anime", "name": "Wit Studio", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/858/Wit_Studio"}], "score": 8.51, "licensors": ["Funimation"], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 5114, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5114/Fullmetal_Alchemist__Brotherhood", "title": "Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1223/96541.jpg", "synopsis": "After a horrific alchemy experiment goes wrong in the Elric household, brothers Edward and Alphonse are left in a catastrophic new reality.

A select few among mankind took to the stars in a spacefaring vessel called the Aratrum in search of \"the promised land,\" the planet Tau-e that could sustain human life. But the migration plan fails, and the remnants of the human race decide to return to Earth. But the distortions in space-time and the distance traveled means that mankind is returning to a completely changed Earth some 20,000 years later. The returnees, led by hero Haruo, prepare to take the fight to Godzilla based on a strategy that has been 20 years in the making. Carried out with the help of two alien species, the Exif and the Bilusaludo, the humans succeed in defeating Godzilla in a costly battle to the death.\r\n\r\nBut the victory is short-lived. Rising from the depths of the planet is a new breed of monster, dubbed \"Godzilla Earth.\" Evolving for 20,000 years, the creature stands 300 meters high, weighs over 100,000 tons and wields such overwhelmingly destructive power that Haruo and company have no choice but to run for their lives.\r\n\r\nComing to Haruo's rescue, however, is Miana, a member of an aboriginal tribe called the Houtua. They are the first humanoid people the returnees have encountered. Could they descend from humans? \"Our tribal god was destroyed by Godzilla. All that we have left are these eggs. Anyone who has tried to fight or resist him has been drowned in fire,\" the tribespeople say to Haruo, who responds with: \"This is our last hope of recovering our home.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Bilusaludo commander, Galu-gu is elated to discover that the Houtua tribe's arrowheads are made of a nanometal or a self-sustaining metal. It had been developed in the 21st century as an \"anti-Godzilla\" killer weapon deployed at their decisive battle fought at the foot of Mt. Fuji, but had been destroyed before it could be activated in the form of a \"Mecha-Godzilla.\" The nanometal was its base substance, and proof that the manufacturing plant can still be used.\r\n\r\n(Source: Official site)", "type": "Movie", "airing_start": "2018-05-17T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 1, "members": 33742, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "source": "Original", "producers": [{"mal_id": 1023, "type": "anime", "name": "Polygon Pictures", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1023/Polygon_Pictures"}], "score": 6.59, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 25313, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/25313/Gintama__Futon_ni_Haitte_kara_Buki_Nokoshi_ni_Kizuite_Neru_ni_Nerenai_Toki_mo_Aru", "title": "Gintama': Futon ni Haitte kara Buki Nokoshi ni Kizuite Neru ni Nerenai Toki mo Aru", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1327/110925.jpg", "synopsis": "Bundled with limited edition of the 58th Gintama manga volume.\r\n\r\nThe tagline for the bundled anime reads, \"It's time for all the Yorozuya members ...to wake up just one more time.\"\r\n\r\n(Source: MAL News, edited)", "type": "Special", "airing_start": "2015-04-02T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 1, "members": 33717, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 20, "type": "anime", "name": "Parody", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/20/Parody"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "source": "Manga", "producers": [{"mal_id": 14, "type": "anime", "name": "Sunrise", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/14/Sunrise"}], "score": 8.1, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 1157, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/1157/Final_Fantasy__Unlimited", "title": "Final Fantasy: Unlimited", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/9/20919.jpg", "synopsis": "Years ago, the opening of an interdimensional portal released two beasts into the skies over the Sea of Japan, visible to all the countries along the coast.

He leads a very difficult life, but tries to make the most of it through the love that he feels for his childhood friend Jay. Unfortunately, Jay may be more interested in her security commander Cade than in Shua, and thus a love triangle is formed. Not only does Shua have to deal with the heartbreak, but he must also find a new way to survive in the crumbles left from the once-beautiful planet Earth.", "type": "Movie", "airing_start": "2003-07-16T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 1, "members": 32595, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 8, "type": "anime", "name": "Drama", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/8/Drama"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "source": "Original", "producers": [], "score": 7.03, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 12053, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/12053/Mardock_Scramble__The_Third_Exhaust", "title": "Mardock Scramble: The Third Exhaust", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/12/39309.jpg", "synopsis": "The final plans to finish Shell off in court have been made by Easter, Balot, and Oeufcoque.

Of course, there's also lots of traffic to contend with, including a fair number of heavy trucks. Because of this, the action is inherently hazardous, and wrecks are common. Blown engines are also a frequent hazard, especially with the extreme-high power engines. \n\nOne day, Akio Asakura, a third year high school student, is driving his Fairlady Z (Z31) and is challenged by Tatsuya Shima, a doctor, in his black Porsche 964 Turbo (nicknamed the \"BlackBird\"). With a friend in the passenger seat and two girls in the back, Akio pitifully tries to win, but is defeated. Determined to become faster, he goes to the junkyard to buy parts for his car, when he sees a pristine, unscratched midnight blue Fairlady Z (S30) in the junkyard. Intrigued as to why such a machine is about to be junked, he buys it. He soon finds that the car is unnaturally fast due to a tuned L28 engine, bored and stroked to 3.1 liters combined with twin turbos, which produces 620bhp. He also finds that all of the car's previous owners had unfortunate accidents in it, starting with the first owner's death. The manga follows Akio's various encounters, though the central plot revolves around his constant battle with the BlackBird for superiority. \n\n(Source: AniDB) ", "type": "TV", "airing_start": "2007-06-14T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 26, "members": 31023, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 30, "type": "anime", "name": "Sports", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/30/Sports"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 3, "type": "anime", "name": "Cars", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/3/Cars"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 42, "type": "anime", "name": "Seinen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/42/Seinen"}], "source": "Manga", "producers": [{"mal_id": 179, "type": "anime", "name": "A.C.G.T.", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/179/ACGT"}], "score": 7.45, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 49930, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/49930/Genjitsu_Shugi_Yuusha_no_Oukoku_Saikenki_Part_2", "title": "Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki Part 2", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1329/118039.jpg", "synopsis": "Second part of Genjitsu Shugi Yuusha no Oukoku Saikenki.", "type": "TV", "airing_start": null, "episodes": null, "members": 30987, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Fantasy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/10/Fantasy"}, {"mal_id": 22, "type": "anime", "name": "Romance", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/22/Romance"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "source": "Light novel", "producers": [{"mal_id": 7, "type": "anime", "name": "J.C.Staff", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/7/JCStaff"}], "score": null, "licensors": ["Funimation"], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 5251, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/5251/Angel_Densetsu", "title": "Angel Densetsu", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/27104.jpg", "synopsis": "When Seikichi Kuroda\u2014self-proclaimed \"guardian\" and head thug of Hekikuu High School\u2014hears rumors of a first-year transfer student named Seiichirou Kitano terrorizing his entire class, Seikichi tries to intimidate him through authority.

But 20,000 years have passed in their absence, and the Earth is a wholly different place.\r\n\r\nThe planet's flora and fauna now embody and serve Godzilla. Earth is a monster's planet, ruled by the largest Godzilla ever at 300 meters in height. Godzilla Earth.\r\n\r\nHuman protagonist, Captain Haruo, yearns to defeat Godzilla and retake the planet for mankind. There, he meets aboriginal descendants of the human race, the Houtua tribe. The Houtua twin sisters, Maina and Miana, lead him to the skeletal remains of Mecha-Godzilla, an old anti-Godzilla weapon, which to everyone's surprise is still alive in the form of self-generating nanometal. Taken from the Mecha-Godzilla carcass, the nanometals have gradually been rebuilding a \"Mecha-Godzilla City,\" a potential weapon capable of destroying Godzilla Earth.\r\n\r\nAs the strategy develops, a rift forms between the humans and the Bilusaludo, one of several alien races that had joined the humans on their exodus from Earth. Their leader, Galu-gu, believes that the secret to defeating Godzilla lies in the use of superhuman powers \u2013 namely, the nanometal integration \u2013 but Haruo resists, fearing that in defeating monsters, they must not become monsters themselves. Haruo ultimately uses his means for defeating Godzilla Earth to destroy the Mecha-Godzilla city so as to prevent nanometal assimilation, killing Galu-gu. However, his childhood friend, Yuuko, has been absorbed by the nanometal integration and has fallen into a brain dead coma.\r\n\r\nThe human race, once again, is lost. Metphies, commander of the priestly alien race, Exif, marvels at the miraculous survival of Haruo, he begins to attract a following. The Exif has secretly harbored this outcome as their \"ultimate goal.\" Miana and Maina issue warnings against Metphies, while Haruo begins to question mankind's next move.\r\n\r\nWith no means for defeating Godzilla Earth, mankind watches as King Ghidorah, clad in a golden light, descends on the planet. The earth shakes once again with as war moves to a higher dimension.\r\n\r\nWhat is Godzilla exactly? Does mankind stand a chance? Is there a future vision in Haruo's eyes?

Fifty years have passed since mankind developed the Network society. It was anticipated that this new infrastructure would realize a utopia where people connected with each other at the level of consciousness. However, new social problems such as personal data leaks and proliferation of manipulated information began to surface. Nevertheless, people still relied on the Network to exchange information, and proved unable to opt to abandon it.\n\nIn due course, a new Network realm with more effective security measures was developed. This was called Meta Real Network, usually abbreviated as \"the Metal.\"\n\nThe Metal accommodated personal memory data within protected virtual stand-alone organic cyber enclaves called bubble shells and eventually pervaded the everyday lives of people.\n\nHowever, people gradually learned to release and explode their instincts within the secure environment of the Metal. The unleashed instincts pushed each individual's consciousness to drown in the sea of information and to be exposed to the pressures of desire. Meanwhile, norms and regulations continued to bind their real world lives. Thus, strange friction between the two worlds began to manifest themselves as aberrations beyond the bounds of the imaginable.\n\nExperts who challenged the deep sea of the Metal to investigate and decipher such aberrations were called cyber divers.\n\nThis is a story of a cyber diver, Masamichi Haru, who investigates the incidents that lie between Reality and the Metal.\n\n(Source: Production I.G)", "type": "TV", "airing_start": "2008-04-08T15:59:00+00:00", "episodes": 26, "members": 23827, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 24, "type": "anime", "name": "Sci-Fi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/24/Sci-Fi"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [], "demographics": [], "source": "Original", "producers": [{"mal_id": 10, "type": "anime", "name": "Production I.G", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/10/Production_IG"}], "score": 7.12, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 876, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/876/Street_Fighter_II_V", "title": "Street Fighter II V", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/6/29992.jpg", "synopsis": "Ryu and Ken Masters are close friends and both are martial artists.

However, when they arrive in the capital, they discover that the government has been overthrown and the deity Susanoo now reigns in its place. The streets of the city and the people in them are much different than Takasugi and Katsura remembered. The times may have changed but their mission hasn't - Takasugi and Katsura resolve to reset time and save their nation from the nefarious forces trying to hijack it.\r\n\r\n(Source: Tokyo Otaku Mode)", "type": "TV", "airing_start": "2018-10-04T16:58:00+00:00", "episodes": 12, "members": 20846, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}, {"mal_id": 21, "type": "anime", "name": "Samurai", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/21/Samurai"}], "demographics": [], "source": "Game", "producers": [{"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Deen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/37/Studio_Deen"}], "score": 5.74, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 30250, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/30250/Triage_X__Recollection_XOXO", "title": "Triage X: Recollection XOXO", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1550/103213.jpg", "synopsis": "Unaired episode 11 of the Triage X series bundled with the 12th manga volume.", "type": "OVA", "airing_start": "2015-11-01T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 1, "members": 20826, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}], "explicit_genres": [{"mal_id": 9, "type": "anime", "name": "Ecchi", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/9/Ecchi"}], "themes": [{"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "source": "Manga", "producers": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Xebec", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/27/Xebec"}], "score": 6.5, "licensors": ["Sentai Filmworks"], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 10479, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/10479/Beelzebub_Specials", "title": "Beelzebub Specials", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/31637.jpg", "synopsis": "Beelzebub specials included in the BD/DVD releases.", "type": "Special", "airing_start": "2011-06-28T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 16, "members": 20819, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 4, "type": "anime", "name": "Comedy", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/4/Comedy"}, {"mal_id": 37, "type": "anime", "name": "Supernatural", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/37/Supernatural"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 6, "type": "anime", "name": "Demons", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/6/Demons"}, {"mal_id": 23, "type": "anime", "name": "School", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/23/School"}], "demographics": [{"mal_id": 27, "type": "anime", "name": "Shounen", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/27/Shounen"}], "source": "Original", "producers": [{"mal_id": 1129, "type": "anime", "name": "Pierrot Plus", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1129/Pierrot_Plus"}, {"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Studio Pierrot", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/1/Studio_Pierrot"}], "score": 7.36, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 39506, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/39506/Phantasy_Star_Online_2__Episode_Oracle", "title": "Phantasy Star Online 2: Episode Oracle", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/1923/99744.jpg", "synopsis": "A TV anime adaptation of episode 1-3 out of 5 the total episodes from the Phantasy Star Online 2 game.

One significant difference is its highly positive portrayal of its main character, Cao Cao, who is traditionally the antagonist in not only Japanese manga, but also most novel versions of the Three Kingdoms period, including the original 14th century version, Romance of the Three Kingdoms by Luo Guanzhong. Another significant difference from others is that the storyline primarily uses the original historical account of the era, Records of Three Kingdoms by Chen Shou, as a reference rather than the aforementioned Romance of the Three Kingdoms novel. By this, the traditional hero of Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Liu Bei, takes on relatively less importance within the story and is portrayed in a less positive light. Yet, several aspects of the story are in fact based on the novel version, including the employment of its original characters such as Diao Chan, as well as anachronistic weapons such as Guan Yu's Green Dragon Crescent Blade and Zhang Fei's Viper Blade.\n\nA consistent theme throughout the story is Cao Cao's perpetual desire to break China and its people away from its old systems and ways of thinking and initiate a focus on pragmatism over empty ideals. This often puts him at odds with the prevalent customs and notions of Confucianism and those that support them.\n\n(Source: Wikipedia)", "type": "TV", "airing_start": "2009-04-07T15:00:00+00:00", "episodes": 26, "members": 16703, "genres": [{"mal_id": 1, "type": "anime", "name": "Action", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/1/Action"}, {"mal_id": 2, "type": "anime", "name": "Adventure", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/2/Adventure"}], "explicit_genres": [], "themes": [{"mal_id": 13, "type": "anime", "name": "Historical", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/genre/13/Historical"}], "demographics": [], "source": "Manga", "producers": [{"mal_id": 11, "type": "anime", "name": "Madhouse", "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/producer/11/Madhouse"}], "score": 7.27, "licensors": [], "r18": false, "kids": false}, {"mal_id": 3349, "url": "https://myanimelist.net/anime/3349/Kiddy_GiRL-AND", "title": "Kiddy GiRL-AND", "image_url": "https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/4/74159.jpg", "synopsis": "Twenty-five years after \u00c9clair and Lumi\u00e8re, (from the flagship Kiddy Grade series), rescued the galaxy from destruction's doorstep, the GTO (Galactic Trade Organization), created after the defeat of the GOTT (Galactic Organization of Trade and Tariffs), act on behalf of universal peace by combating criminal activity.\r\n\r\nTheir special ES division mirrored after the GOTT's ES (Encounter of Shadow-work) force, now includes publicly acknowledged ES member candidates.
